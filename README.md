# Modelling Work Strees with Structural Equations (SEM)

We aim to fit a Structural Equation Model (SEM) following the exercise proposed by Petri Nokelainen from the Research Centre for Vocational Education, University of Tampere, Finland. The exercise was carried using R and the lavaan package. Documentation for this exercise can be found [here](https://www.scribd.com/document/222003310/Sem-Exercise-v2-5). 

We used the proposed data set with 447 rows and 27 columns. The respondents in both samples are staff members of Finnish polytechnic institute for higher education. The original measurement instrument (Growth-oriented Atmosphere Questionnaire, GOAQ) has 13 factors and 92-items (Ruohotie, 1996; Ruohotie, Nokelainen & Tirri, 2002), but for the purposes of this exercise Nokelainen selected 13 factors and 27 items, all consisting of a fiveâ€“point Likert scale from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree) was applied (Nokelainen, n.d.).
